# Number-Recognition-Python
This program uses a stochastic gradient decent neural network to recognize handwritten numbers using only pygame and PIL to create a display for the user. I used the mnist handwritter digit data set to train the network. Included is a text file containing the weights for a network that has been trained for 10,000 iterations to demonstrate its abilities. If you want to train the neural network, you'll need to download the mnist dataset from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
